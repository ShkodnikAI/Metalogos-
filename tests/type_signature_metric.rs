// ── Naryad #467 (P1, types/rust): the typed-signature metric — the
// in-tree double lock ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The stage-0 CI metric lives in `scripts/ci/type_signature_share.py`
// (the `type-signatures` job prints the share on every run and gates it
// against the checked-in floor). This test is the same floor enforced
// from INSIDE the binary, over the live `BUILTIN_REGISTRY` — the two
// locks cannot drift: the script counts the source rows, the test
// counts the compiled specs.
//
// The rule (the owner's strengthening): the typed-signature share rises
// every release — a regression (a typed row losing its type, or the
// floor falling) fails here exactly as it fails the CI gate.

use metalogos::builtins::{sig_types::Type, BUILTIN_REGISTRY};

/// The checked-in floor: raised by №590 (2026-10-05 — the Box–Muller
/// normal sampler ships typed PRECISE "Float" over the shared PRNG; the
/// row is a default-feature `math` builtin, so both counts move: source
/// 194, compiled +1). The by-design gap continues (see
/// part 1's comment): the CI script counts SOURCE rows (194 — the same 4
/// gated vec/store rows ride only there), this test counts the COMPILED
/// default-feature registry (190). MUST move only up, in the same PR
/// that types more rows — AND together with
/// `scripts/ci/type_signature_baseline.txt` (`# threshold_bp: 3759`).
/// The general share 3759 bp ≥ the 0.29 gate goal 3500 (ADR-0181).
